# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: fullstack-app-ai

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern businesses need a seamless platform to manage users and enable real-time messaging, all while providing a fast, secure, and scalable user experience. Existing solutions are often fragmented or lack modern best practices in both frontend and backend architecture.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- Deliver a fullstack web application with a modern, responsive UI and robust backend.
- Allow users to register, authenticate, and message each other securely.
- Ensure best practices in security, performance, and maintainability.
- Provide a scalable foundation for future features (e.g., notifications, file sharing).

## 3. Features

### MVP Features
- **User Registration & Authentication**
  - Sign up, log in, and log out
  - Secure password storage
- **User Profiles**
  - View and edit profile information
- **Messaging**
  - Send and receive messages between users
  - View message history
- **Frontend**
  - Responsive design (desktop & mobile)
  - Modern UI components (using shadcn, Tailwind, etc.)
- **Backend**
  - RESTful API for users and messages
  - Serve static frontend assets
  - Best-practices middleware (security, logging, CORS, compression)

### Future Features
- Real-time messaging (WebSockets)
- User presence/online status
- File/image sharing
- Admin dashboard
- Notifications

## 4. User Stories

- **As a new user**, I want to sign up so I can use the platform.
- **As a returning user**, I want to log in securely so I can access my account.
- **As a user**, I want to view and edit my profile so my information is up to date.
- **As a user**, I want to send messages to other users so I can communicate with them.
- **As a user**, I want to see my message history so I can reference past conversations.

## 5. Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI
- **Backend:** Express, Node.js
- **API:** RESTful endpoints for users and messages
- **Middleware:** helmet, cors, morgan, compression, centralized error handling
- **Static Assets:** Serve built frontend from Express
- **Authentication:** JWT or session-based (to be decided)
- **Database:** (To be added; e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- **Testing:** (To be added; e.g., Jest, Supertest)

## 6. Success Metrics

- Users can register, log in, and message each other without errors
- All endpoints are secure and protected from common vulnerabilities
- The app loads quickly and is responsive on all devices
- Codebase is maintainable and ready for future features

## 7. Open Questions

- Which database will be used for production?
- What authentication method will be implemented (JWT vs. sessions)?
- Will messaging be real-time in MVP or added later?
- What are the requirements for admin features?
